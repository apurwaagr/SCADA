SCADA Market Trends


Increased adoption of Al and IoT in manufacturing industries to propel the market growth


Manufacturing operations have changed as a result of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). Industrial loT is the term for the use of loT in manufacturing industries (loT). By utilising SCADA systems to connect a vast network of intelligent devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) is changing manufacturing facilities. A fully digital plant is created as a result. In order to monitor and control their applications and processes, achieve faster response times, and more accurately predict machine failure, industries can benefit from SCADA systems enabled with loT and Al technologies. This lowers operational costs and boosts productivity. Thus, the combination of loT and Al-based SCADA platforms facilitates data transmission and analysis for streamlined plant operations. Furthermore, because loT technology can detect possible issues and stop them from arising, it also contributes to a reduction in downtime. Additionally, loT speeds up and improves maintenance. With the use of this technology, managers can carefully plan out maintenance and maintain systems operational while all personnel are working. LoT can improve equipment longevity, lessen environmental risks, and promote plant safety. Machine learning (ML), a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), provides powerful tools for performing predictive maintenance. Thus, this factor is driving the market CAGR.
Furthermore, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, and water and wastewater treatment are just a few of the industries that use wireless sensor networks (WSN). The majority of oil and gas facilities are situated in harsh environments in distant locations. With the aid of sensors placed in a WSN, a SCADA system in an oil and gas plant monitors, manages, and controls tanks, compressors, generators, and separators. Implementing a sensor network and communication system is more affordable when a WSN is used. Additionally, they assist in resolving the issues with wired industrial networks because of their flexibility and ease of deployment. Due to the extra hardware requirements, such as cables, networking equipment, routers, and network adapters, wired technology is more expensive than its wireless version. As a result, the expanding WSN R&D and active use in SCADA systems would broaden the applications for SCADA. Additionally, the regular software updates for SCADA-adopted wireless sensor networks enable them to be compatible with the current automated systems in many different industries.
However, massive development in big data and analytics has boosted the effectiveness of SCADA systems, opening up a wide range of industry potential. Analytical software solutions assist businesses in reducing errors, enhancing decision-making, and locating the source of issues. As a result, more sectors have started using these technologies to create decision-making processes. Analytics tools are now being used by automation suppliers in SCADA and advanced process control (APC). Thus, it is anticipated that this aspect will accelerate SCADA market revenue globally.

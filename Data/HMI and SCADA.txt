From Software for machine-oriented visualization to powerful SCADA systems -

Totally connected, totally digitalized!

As your single-source provider, Siemens’ human machine interface technology SIMATIC HMI is engineered to cope with the increasingly complex processes of your machines and systems. SIMATIC HMI is optimized to meet your specific human machine interface needs using open and standardized interfaces in hardware and software, which allow efficient integration into your automation solution.*


Digitalization is noticeably changing our world – and the world of industry. The data volume in modern industrial plants is growing continuously. This poses new challenges for SCADA solutions: Enormous data volumes must be managed and archived for the long term. At the same time, production processes must be monitored and controlled as reliably, efficiently, and productively as possible and they must be constantly optimized. With its scalable, open system landscape for the vertical integration of data from the production to the MES/ERP level up to cloud solutions, SIMATIC SCADA offers a solution that is ready for the challenges of today and tomorrow.**
